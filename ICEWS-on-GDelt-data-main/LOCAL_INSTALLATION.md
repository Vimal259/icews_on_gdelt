# Local Installation Guide for GDELT Data Visualization with ICEWS Explorer

This guide provides detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the GDELT Data Visualization with ICEWS Explorer application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Step 1: Get the Code

### Option A: Clone the Repository Using Git

If you have Git installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gdelt-icews-explorer.git
cd gdelt-icews-explorer
```

### Option B: Download as ZIP

1. On the repository page, click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/extracted/folder
   ```

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install all the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly requests
```

If you're using a virtual environment (recommended), activate it first:

### For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly requests
```

### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly requests
```

## Step 3: Launch the Application

### Option A: Using the Local Launcher (Recommended)

Run the local launcher script which will set up the proper configuration and start the application:

```bash
python local_launcher.py
```

The application should automatically open in your default web browser.

### Option B: Using Streamlit Directly

Alternatively, you can run the Streamlit app directly:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Step 4: Using the Application

1. Once the application is running, you'll see the GDELT Data Visualization with ICEWS Explorer interface in your web browser
2. Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Data" button in the sidebar to fetch the latest GDELT events from the last 15 minutes
3. Explore the data using the different tabs:
   - Event Analysis: View distributions of event types and timeline
   - Geographic View: Explore events on a world map
   - Data Explorer: Filter and search through the raw event data

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

- **Package installation fails**: Try upgrading pip first: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- **Python version conflicts**: Use a virtual environment with Python 3.7+
- **Permission errors**: 
  - Windows: Try running the command prompt as Administrator
  - macOS/Linux: Use `sudo pip install` or create a virtual environment

### Runtime Issues

- **Import errors**: Ensure you're running the command from the directory containing all the project files
- **Port already in use**: If port 8501 is already in use, Streamlit will try to use another port. Check the terminal output for the URL.
- **Browser doesn't open**: Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser
- **No data displayed**: 
  - Check your internet connection
  - GDELT's API might be temporarily unavailable, try again later
  - Click the "Refresh Data" button again

### GDELT API Issues

- The application relies on GDELT's public API which may have rate limits or occasional downtime
- If you see errors when fetching data, wait a few minutes and try again
- Check the GDELT Project website (https://www.gdeltproject.org/) for any announcements about API availability

## Advanced Configuration

If you need to modify advanced settings:

1. Edit the `.streamlit/config.toml` file for Streamlit configuration
2. To change the port, modify the `port = 8501` line in the config file
3. To enable additional Streamlit features, refer to the [Streamlit configuration documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration)

## Running on Different Platforms

### Windows

- Make sure to use the correct path separators (`\`) in file paths
- If Python is not in your PATH, use the full path to the Python executable

### macOS

- You may need to install developer tools: `xcode-select --install`
- For package installation issues, try using `pip3` instead of `pip`

### Linux

- Ensure you have the required development libraries: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev`
- For visualization issues, you might need to install additional dependencies: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
